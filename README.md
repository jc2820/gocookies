# Go cookies and JWT

Implementing a Go web app with [JWT](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/golang-jwt/jwt) based authorisation via cookie storage for a private route.

This is not a test of secure authentication, encryption or data storage, so the page uses a very obvious password and no attempt to hash and store passwords.
